Pipeline Overview

This pipeline is designed to generate bar plots for 4 categories of genes: protein-coding, ribosomal RNA, mitochondrial RNA, and other non-coding RNA from Raw count
datasets produced from bam files (ex. using HTseq, subread feature counts).



INPUT FILES: 
1) GTF File:
Gene annotations (specifically, the gene type) are extracted from the GTF file downloaded from ENCODE:
https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_35/gencode.v35.basic.annotation.gtf.gz

2) The Korean Dataset:
The dataset (56609x342) can be downloaded from:
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8333650.

3) The Sweden Dataset:
The dataset (19765x1183) is available in the ArrayExpress database under accession number E-MTAB-12862.



PIPELINE AIM:
The pipeline aims to assess the completeness of raw count datasets downloaded from public repositories such as GEO. 
Since raw counts are essential for differential expression analysis using tools like DESeq2 and limma, 
this pipeline is useful for quality control of raw datasets before proceeding with differential analysis.

Specifically, the pipeline calculates the percentage of reads assigned to four gene categories that should be present in a dataset generated using a Total RNA protocol. For each gene in the raw RNA-Seq count tables, 
the pipeline checks its classification into one of the four categories. The percentage of counts in each category is then calculated and visualized in a bar plot.
