Pipeline Overview

This pipeline is designed to generate bar plots for 4 categories of genes: protein-coding, ribosomal RNA, mitochondrial RNA, and other non-coding RNA.

Specifically, gene types (gene_type) are extracted from the GTF file downloaded from ENCODE (gencode.v35.basic.annotation.gtf.gz).

For each gene present in the raw RNA-Seq count tables, the pipeline checks its classification into one of the 4 categories. The percentage of counts for each category is then calculated, and this data is visualized in a bar plot.
